Error in rule map_reads:
    jobid: 0
    input: data/samples/A.fastq, data/genome.fa
    output: results/mapped/A.bam
    shell:
        bwa mem data/samples/A.fastq data/genome.fa | samtools view -Sb - > results/mapped/A.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job map_reads since they might be corrupted:
results/mapped/A.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
